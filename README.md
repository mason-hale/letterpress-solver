To compile, run 'make'.

'make clean' will remove all products of compiling process.

To run, execute ./trie or ./radix followed by 3 strings 
    (no quotes, no separation within strings, strings separated by spaces).

The three strings are as follows
- Letters held by opponent but available to 'steal.'
- Letters that are not held by either player.
- Letters that are held by the player or blocked off by the opponent.

The strings should add up to 25 letters total, and be letters only.
